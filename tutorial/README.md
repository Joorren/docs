# Getting Started Tutorial

Welcome to Craft CMS!

This tutorial will guide you through installing Craft CMS and creating a demo blog. While it assumes you’re technically-inclined, you don’t need web development experience to follow along. You can also skip any parts you’re already familiar with.

## Why Craft CMS?

Craft is a content management system for building bespoke websites. 

There are lots of options when it comes to choosing a CMS, and what makes Craft unique is that it’s a blank slate that puts your content first and offers an excellent developer experience for working with it.

We’ll build an example blog since that’s a common use for a CMS, but the goal is to introduce you to the building blocks you can tailor for *any* kind of content. (This is where Craft shines!)

## What We’re Going to Do

We’re going to get Craft installed and running in a local environment, customize the example blog it ships with, and launch the site on the internet. All you’ll need is yourself, your computer, about an hour, and hopefully a bit of enthusiasm.
